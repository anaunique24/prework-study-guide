# Prework-study-guide

## Description

As a part of my prework for a software development bootcamp, I wanted to create an easily understandable and attainable study guide holding a glimpse of what I was able to learn on my own. In this Repo there are notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript.

## Installation

## Usage

In order to use this study guide, there are easily readable notes when you open the webpage. On the backend, there is a randomly generated topic selector. To acess this open the Chrome DevTools by pressing Command+Option+I (macOS) or Control+Shift+I (Windows). There will be a console pannel on the top, this will take you to the topic selector.
